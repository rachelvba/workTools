## Getting Started

### For VBA Development:
1. Use the templates in the `Templates/VBA/` directory as a starting point for your scripts
2. Store your completed scripts in the appropriate subdirectory in the `VBA/` folder

### For Python Development:
1. Use the templates in the `Templates/Python/` directory as a starting point
2. Store your completed scripts in the appropriate subdirectory in the `Python/` folder

## Using GitHub Copilot Agent

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that can help you write code more efficiently. Here's how to use the GitHub Copilot agent to enhance your financial programming tasks:

### Getting Help with VBA Scripts

To have GitHub Copilot help you create or modify a VBA script:

1. Open an existing VBA file or create a new one in the appropriate directory
2. Type a comment describing what you want to accomplish, for example:
   ```vba
   ' Create a function to calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
   ```
3. GitHub Copilot will suggest code to implement this function
4. Press Tab to accept the suggestion or continue typing to provide more details

### Getting Help with Python Financial Analysis

To have GitHub Copilot help you create or modify a Python script:

1. Open an existing Python file or create a new one in the appropriate directory
2. Type a comment describing what you want to accomplish, for example:
   ```python
   # Create a function to analyze financial ratios from balance sheet data
   ```
3. GitHub Copilot will suggest code to implement this analysis
4. Press Tab to accept the suggestion or continue typing to provide more details

### Using GitHub Copilot with the Coding Agent

For more complex tasks, you can use the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent:

1. In VS Code, open the GitHub Copilot Chat panel (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
2. Include the hashtag `#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent` in your query
3. Describe the task you want accomplished, for example:
   ```
   #github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent Create a Python script that analyzes quarterly financial statements and generates trend charts for key metrics
   ```
4. The coding agent will create a new branch, implement your request, and open a pull request with the changes

### Best Practices for Working with Copilot Agent

1. **Be specific**: The more details you provide, the better GitHub Copilot can assist you
2. **Break down complex tasks**: For intricate financial analyses, break them into smaller components
3. **Review suggestions**: Always review and test code suggestions before implementing them in production
4. **Provide context**: Include information about the financial data structure or specific calculations you need
5. **Iterative refinement**: Use follow-up prompts to refine and improve generated code

### Example Prompts for Financial Tasks

#### VBA Examples:
- "Create a VBA function to calculate bond yields using the time value of money principles"
- "Write a VBA macro to automatically format financial statements in Excel with proper accounting formats"
- "Develop a VBA module to import bank transaction data from CSV files and categorize expenses"

#### Python Examples:
- "Create a Python function to perform Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio risk analysis"
- "Write a Python script to generate a financial dashboard visualizing key performance indicators"
- "Develop a function to calculate optimal portfolio allocation using the Efficient Frontier method"

## Templates

The `Templates` directory contains starter files for common financial programming tasks:

- `BasicModule.bas`: Foundation VBA module with financial utility functions
- `DataImportExport.bas`: VBA module for importing/exporting financial data
- `financial_data_processor.py`: Python template for processing financial data
- `financial_visualization.py`: Python template for creating financial visualizations

## Maintenance and Updates

To keep this workspace up-to-date:

1. Regularly review and update templates with new financial formulas and best practices
2. Document specific usage patterns and examples for your organization's financial processes
3. Share useful scripts and techniques with your team
